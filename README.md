The Task

Write a program that will display an equilateral triangle with a height depending on the user. The minimum height is 1, the maximum height is 10. Use an array to display the specific character on the specific row. The array will be: { 0 := “A”, 1:= “B”, 2 := “C”, 3 := “D”, 4 := “E”, 5 := “F”, 6 := “G”, 7 := “H”, 8 := “I”, 9 := “J” }. You are limited to four (4) variables only (including the array).
